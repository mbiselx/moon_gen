# Moon Surface Generator

The following is a small app allowing one to visualize a surface (such as an elevation model), defined in a python file. 
The purpose is to aid in the development of algorithms to generate nice-looking lunar-like surfaces for lunar rover surface operation simulations. 

## Running
After installation, the project can be run as module:

python -m moon_gen
